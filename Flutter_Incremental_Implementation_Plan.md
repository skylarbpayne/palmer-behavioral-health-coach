## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Each step builds on the previous step
- Test thoroughly before moving to next step
- Keep commits small and focused
- Document any issues or deviations

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing after each step
- Ensure each step's acceptance criteria are met
- Test on both iOS and Android
- Verify data persistence and app lifecycle

### Dependencies Management
- Add dependencies incrementally
- Test each new dependency thoroughly
- Keep dependency versions consistent
- Document any version constraints

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Step 1** - Create hello world Flutter app
2. **Complete each step fully** before moving to the next
3. **Test thoroughly** at each step
4. **Document any issues** encountered during implementation

This incremental approach ensures we have a working app at every stage and can catch issues early in the development process.
