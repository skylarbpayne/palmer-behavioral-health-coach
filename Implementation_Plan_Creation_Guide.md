# Guide: Creating Incremental Implementation Plans

## Overview

This guide documents the best practices for creating incremental implementation plans for software projects, based on lessons learned from creating the Palmer Behavioral Health Coach Flutter implementation plan.

## Key Principles

### 1. Start with the Absolute Minimum
- Begin with "Hello World" equivalent
- Ensure the basic project structure works before adding complexity
- First step should be completable in 1-2 hours maximum

### 2. Make Each Step Standalone and Testable
- Every step should produce a working, demonstrable result
- Each step should have clear acceptance criteria
- User should be able to stop at any step and have something functional

### 3. Add One Feature at a Time
- Resist the urge to combine multiple features in one step
- Each step should focus on a single, clear objective
- Complex features should be broken down into smaller components

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Initial Mistake: Creating a Design Document Instead of Implementation Plan
**What went wrong:** The first attempt was too high-level and architectural, focusing on the final system design rather than incremental steps.

**Solution:** Focus on immediate next steps, not the final architecture. Each step should be actionable within hours, not days.

### Mistake: Making Steps Too Large
**Problem:** Steps that take multiple days make it hard to track progress and debug issues.

**Solution:** Keep steps to 1-8 hours maximum. If a step seems larger, break it down further.

### Mistake: Skipping Basic Infrastructure
**Problem:** Jumping straight to complex features without establishing basics first.

**Solution:** Always start with project setup, basic navigation, and mock data before adding real functionality.

## Step-by-Step Process for Creating Implementation Plans

### Phase 1: Understand the Requirements
1. **Read the full requirements document thoroughly**
2. **Identify the core features and functionality**
3. **Note any specific technology requirements (e.g., flutter_gemma package)**
4. **Understand the data models and architecture needs**

### Phase 2: Create the Increment Progression
1. **Start with "Hello World"**
   - Basic project setup
   - Minimal UI that runs on target platforms
   - Should take 1-2 hours maximum

2. **Add Basic Structure**
   - Navigation framework
   - Placeholder screens
   - Basic app shell

3. **Add Mock Data Features**
   - Implement UI with hardcoded/mock data
   - Focus on layout and basic functionality
   - No real data persistence yet

4. **Add Simple Data Persistence**
   - Basic local storage
   - Simple data models
   - Data survives app restarts

5. **Add Core Business Logic**
   - Real functionality without external dependencies
   - Profile management, basic services
   - Internal state management

6. **Add External Dependencies**
   - Third-party packages (AI, encryption, etc.)
   - Network features
   - Complex integrations

7. **Add Polish and Advanced Features**
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Security features

### Phase 3: Define Each Step Clearly

For each step, include:

#### Required Elements
- **Goal:** One-sentence description of what this step achieves
- **Deliverables:** Concrete, testable outcomes
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Checkbox list of requirements

#### Optional Elements (when relevant)
- **New Dependencies:** Any packages to add
- **Files to create/modify:** Specific file changes
- **Implementation notes:** Key technical decisions

### Phase 4: Validate the Plan

#### Check Each Step
- [ ] Can be completed in stated time estimate
- [ ] Produces working, demonstrable result
- [ ] Has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Builds logically on previous steps
- [ ] Is focused on single objective

#### Check Overall Plan
- [ ] Progresses from simple to complex
- [ ] Each step adds meaningful value
- [ ] Plan is realistic for available time
- [ ] Major risks are addressed early
- [ ] Dependencies are introduced at right time

## Template for Implementation Steps

```markdown
## Step X: [Clear, Action-Oriented Title]

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this step achieves]

**Deliverables:**
- [Concrete outcome 1]
- [Concrete outcome 2]
- [Concrete outcome 3]

**New Dependencies:** (if any)
```yaml
dependencies:
  package_name: ^version
```

**Files to create/modify:**
- `path/to/file.dart` - Brief description of changes
- `path/to/other_file.dart` - Brief description of changes

**Implementation Notes:** (if needed)
- Key technical decisions
- Important considerations
- Potential challenges

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Specific testable requirement 1
- [ ] Specific testable requirement 2
- [ ] Specific testable requirement 3
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android (if applicable)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
```

## Technology-Specific Considerations

### For Flutter Projects
- Always start with `flutter create project_name`
- Include platform testing (iOS/Android) in acceptance criteria
- Consider widget testing from early steps
- Add dependencies incrementally to avoid conflicts

### For React/React Native Projects
- Start with `create-react-app` or `expo init`
- Consider state management needs early
- Plan for both web and mobile if applicable
- Include hot reload testing in acceptance criteria

### For Backend Projects
- Start with basic server setup and "Hello World" endpoint
- Add one route/endpoint per step
- Include API testing in acceptance criteria
- Consider database setup as separate step

## Quality Assurance

### Before Finalizing Plan
1. **Review with fresh eyes** - Does each step make sense in isolation?
2. **Check time estimates** - Are they realistic based on complexity?
3. **Validate progression** - Does each step logically build on previous?
4. **Consider edge cases** - What could go wrong at each step?

### During Implementation
1. **Track actual time** vs estimates for future planning
2. **Document deviations** from plan and reasons
3. **Update acceptance criteria** if needed
4. **Note any steps that should be split further**

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Developers
- **Continuous progress** - Always have something working
- **Easy debugging** - Problems isolated to recent changes
- **Motivation** - Regular completion of milestones
- **Flexibility** - Can pivot or adjust based on learnings

### For Project Management
- **Clear progress tracking** - Easy to see what's done
- **Risk mitigation** - Issues caught early
- **Scope management** - Easy to adjust timeline
- **Stakeholder updates** - Regular demonstrations possible

## Conclusion

Creating effective incremental implementation plans requires discipline to start simple and build gradually. The key is resisting the urge to design the perfect final system upfront, and instead focusing on the immediate next step that will provide value and learning.

Remember: **A working "Hello World" is infinitely more valuable than a perfect architectural plan that hasn't been implemented.**
